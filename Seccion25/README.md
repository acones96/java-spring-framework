# Microservices

A microservice is a small, independent, and loosely coupled service that is part of a larger system, where multiple microservices work together to form a complete application. 

This kind of architecture is more modern than a monolithic architecture, where the hole application is a single, unified codebase where all components are tightly coupled and run as one unit, but where a small bug can bring down the entire system and his development is slower.

Some characteristics of microservices are:
1. **Single Responsibility.** Each microservice focuses on a specific functionality.
2. **Independently Deployable.** Can update or scale one microservice without affecting others.
3. **Decentralized Data Management.** Each service can have its own database.
4. **Lightweight Communication.** They communicate using APIs (usually REST or gRPC).
5. **Technology Agnostic.** Each microservice can use different programming language, framework, or database.

## Advantages
* **Scalability.** Can scale necessary parts.
* **Faster Development.** Can work with different teams for different services simultaneously.
* **Better Fault Isolation.** A bug in one microservice won't crash the entire system.
* **Flexibility.** Can mix different technologies.

## Disadvantages
* Might be overkill for small applications.
* Can be complex if your team lacks experience in distributed systems.
