# Working with Java Based Configuration
Instead of using an spring.xml, we will be using Java Based Configuration.

We work with most of the files, but in certain point we stop working with src/main/java/org/telusko/config/AppConfig.java, which is now commented, to be able to work only with @Component and @Autowired annotations in Desktop, Laptop and Alien classes
