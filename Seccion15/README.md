# Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data ecosystem, and it simplifies working with JPA (Java Persistence API) by providing easy and consistent data access layers in Java applications. Essentially, it abstracts a lot of the boilerplate code required for database interactions, letting developers focus more on business logic.

## Key Concepts

* **JPA (Java Persistence API):** A specification for object-relational mapping (ORM). It helps map Java objects to database tables.
* **Hibernate:** A popular implementation of JPA, often used with Spring Data JPA.
* **Repositories:** Interfaces that handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without you having to write SQL or HQL queries.

## ORM

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using the object-oriented paradigm of the programming language.

In simpler terms, ORM lets you map database tables to Java (or other language) objects. This means you can manipulate data using objects and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries.
